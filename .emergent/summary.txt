The AI engineer's work in this trajectory primarily focused on two major phases: enabling HTTPS for the self-hosted application and then deploying the full-stack application. Initially, persistent Certbot issues for  were debugged, revealing an IPv6 DNS record misconfiguration that prevented challenge verification. This was resolved by instructing the user to remove the AAAA record at their domain registrar, followed by fixing Nginx port binding errors after Certbot's configuration changes. Subsequently, efforts shifted to deploying the FastAPI backend and React frontend. The backend deployment involved providing , , , , and a complete , alongside extensive MySQL user/database creation and schema import debugging (root access, TEXT column defaults). FastAPI service issues were resolved by correcting the systemd unit ( instead of ), installing missing , and  modules, and correcting  syntax. The backend is now functional. Frontend deployment began with a basic HTML/JS version, which the user rejected. The current work involves recreating the sophisticated React frontend step-by-step on the VPS, having established the basic project structure and installed dependencies in .

The primary objective is to develop a mobile-friendly barbershop website, Fris√∏r LaFata, featuring a retro black/gold theme. It must include a homepage, subpages, and a robust booking system with staff/service/time selection, email confirmations, and payment options. An English admin dashboard is required for managing bookings, staff, services, pages, and settings. Key feature enhancements include a rich text editor, email templates, advanced booking management, user accounts, a before/after gallery, reminders, revenue tracking, staff break management, enhanced staff portfolios, customizable service icons, social media integration, home service options, and booking toggles. Recent additions by the previous AI engineer included an administrative homepage editor, improved staff display, a corporate booking system, dynamic background image transparency, and UI fixes (input focus, static navigation). The immediate past user requests focused on implementing complete multi-language support, a responsive logo, a video background option for the hero section with text overlay, and a comprehensive self-hosting deployment solution (cPanel/VPS) with custom MySQL configuration and SSL.

-   ****: This file contains the complete FastAPI backend logic, including API routes for authentication, user management, staff, services, bookings, and site settings. It now correctly uses MySQL via , and has had MongoDB imports and configurations removed. Pydantic models define the data structures for all API interactions.
-   ****: Handles MySQL database connections, connection pooling, and utility functions for executing queries, inserting, updating, and deleting records. It also includes serialization/deserialization logic for JSON fields.
-   ****: Defines the MySQL database structure, including tables for users, staff, services, bookings, gallery, pages, site settings, and staff breaks. It has been fixed to address  column default value issues.
-   ****: This Nginx configuration is crucial for serving the frontend and proxying API requests to the backend. It now includes the  block to allow Certbot verification and correctly handles HTTPS redirects.
-   ****: This systemd service unit manages the FastAPI backend process, ensuring it runs automatically and restarts on failure. It was corrected to point to  for uvicorn.
-   ****: Defines the React application and its dependencies, including , , , , , , and development dependencies like , , , .
-   ****: The main HTML template for the React application, including basic metadata and a Tailwind CSS CDN setup for initial styling.
-   ****: The root component of the React application, setting up the  for navigation, handling user authentication (login/logout), and fetching current user information. It orchestrates the rendering of  or  based on authentication status.
-   ****: Contains custom CSS rules that extend Tailwind CSS, defining theming (gold colors), animations (fade-in, slide-in-left), and specific styles for hero sections, admin dashboard, forms, and tables.
-   ****: Renders the main public-facing parts of the application, including the hero section (with dynamic video background), services, staff, and contact information. It fetches data dynamically from the backend and includes calls to , , and .
-   ****: Provides the top navigation bar, featuring site title, links to sections, booking button, admin button, and a mobile-responsive menu.
-   ****: Implements a multi-step booking form, allowing users to select services, staff, date, time, and provide customer information. It interacts with the backend for available slots and booking creation.
-   ****: A UI component for switching between Danish and English translations, updating the i18n context.
-   ****: The administrative interface, featuring a sidebar for navigation between dashboard overview, bookings, services, staff, and settings. It fetches and displays data from the backend, allowing administrators to manage the barbershop.

<pending_tasks>
- Complete the creation and deployment of the full React frontend application on the VPS.
- Implement the Homepage Editor drag-and-drop functionality using .
- Implement Phase 3 features (Loyalty points system, Recurring bookings, Gift Certificates, etc.).
- Debug the booking modal which is currently not opening (though a basic version is present, full functionality needs verification).
- Fully deploy the complete FastAPI backend and static frontend assets to the user's self-hosted server (backend is mostly done, frontend is in progress).

<current_work>
The previous AI engineer successfully secured the self-hosted server by installing SSL certificates for  and  via Certbot, resolving an IPv6 DNS issue and Nginx configuration conflicts. The FastAPI backend has been almost entirely migrated to MySQL, configured, and deployed as a systemd service () running on . This backend now correctly responds to API calls like  and .

However, the initial frontend provided by the AI was a basic HTML/JS site, which the user found unsatisfactory as it lacked the sophisticated UI and features of the original React application. The current task involves rebuilding the entire React frontend from scratch directly on the user's VPS at . The AI has created the directory structure, , , , , , , , , and . The content for these files is being provided in parts, with , , , , and  being the most recent additions. The process is paused in the middle of creating .
