The AI engineer's work spanned multiple critical areas: enhancing the user interface, resolving persistent bugs, and implementing new features. Initial efforts included setting up basic infrastructure for homepage editing and resolving database connectivity issues by temporarily reverting to MongoDB for specific endpoints. The core of the recent work involved fulfilling direct user requests: implementing staff social media integration with improved display, fixing a complex input focus loss bug in admin forms, making the navigation menu static and mobile-responsive, and adding a corporate booking system. A significant portion of the trajectory was dedicated to debugging persistent frontend loading issues related to API calls and image display, which involved identifying domain mismatches and ensuring proper data fetching. Finally, the engineer began work on introducing multi-language support as per a user query.

<product_requirements>
The Frisor LaFata barbershop requires a mobile-friendly website with a retro black/gold aesthetic. Key functionalities include a homepage, subpages (services, about, contact), a robust booking system (staff/service selection, time slots, Danish email confirmations, PayPal/pay-in-person), and a comprehensive English admin dashboard for managing bookings, staff, services, pages, and settings.

Implemented enhancements include: rich text editor for page management, customizable email templates, advanced booking management (rescheduling, double-booking prevention), backend user accounts, a before/after gallery, automated booking reminders, revenue tracking, staff break management, enhanced staff portfolios, customizable service icons, a social media feed section, home service booking, and a booking system toggle. Most recently, an administrative homepage editor for section customization was partially implemented, staff member display was improved with larger avatars and social media links, a comprehensive corporate booking system was added, dynamic background image transparency was introduced, and core UI issues such as input focus loss and navigation instability were resolved.

<current_work>
The AI engineer is currently in the process of demonstrating how to implement multi-language support for the application. This initiative was triggered by a user's query regarding the feasibility and effort involved.

Immediate actions before this summary included:
1.  **Dependency Installation**: Installed the  library using yarn add v1.22.22
info Visit https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/cli/add for documentation about this command..
2.  **File Structure Creation**: Established the necessary directory and file structure for  integration:
    *    (for i18n configuration)
    *    (for Danish translations)
    *    (for English translations)
3.  **Language Switcher Component**: Created a placeholder component  within  to provide a UI element for language selection.

The AI engineer's last action was to explain and show how individual components (e.g., the hero section) would need to be updated to utilize the new  framework for translations. The goal is to provide a working example to the user for confirmation before proceeding with full implementation.
