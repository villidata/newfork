<analysis>
The AI engineer's work primarily focused on progressively enhancing the Frisor LaFata barbershop application and resolving critical bugs. Initial efforts addressed React input field focus loss issues in forms (Staff and Pages) by refactoring components to prevent unnecessary re-renders using  and component extraction. A significant bug involving TinyMCE API key validation was resolved by configuring the editor for offline (JSDelivr CDN) use. Image display issues, caused by an infrastructure proxy overriding content-types, were fixed by implementing a custom backend image-serving endpoint and migrating all existing image URLs. New features included customizable service icons and a comprehensive social media feed section with admin configuration. A major architectural shift was initiated to migrate the database from MongoDB to MySQL, involving schema creation, driver installation, data migration, and partial backend endpoint conversion. The latest work involves adding home service booking options and a booking system toggle, which have been successfully implemented and tested. The current, immediate task is to implement a homepage editor with drag-and-drop functionality, with the first step being the installation of .

<current_work>
The AI engineer is currently in the process of implementing a homepage customization system. This system will allow the user to reorder sections (drag & drop), edit content, show/hide sections, and customize styling.

Immediate actions before this summary included:
1.  **Database Schema Update**: Modified  to include a  table for storing layout configurations.
2.  **API Endpoints**: Added new FastAPI endpoints in  (, , ) to manage homepage layout data.
3.  **Frontend Component Creation**: Created a new React component  within  as the interface for this feature.
4.  **Dependency Installation**: The last action taken was planning to install  to enable the drag-and-drop functionality for reordering homepage sections.

This work is part of a larger initiative to provide greater control over the main page's design and content. The backend infrastructure for storing layout information and exposing it via API is set up, and the frontend component structure is initiated.
