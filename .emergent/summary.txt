The AI engineer's work trajectory details the development of the Frisor LaFata barbershop application, progressively adding significant features and addressing bugs. Initial tasks involved resolving staff avatar display issues, which required fixing backend static file serving, correcting hardcoded URLs, and updating database entries for existing avatars. This was followed by implementing a comprehensive page management system, enabling blog-style pages with a TinyMCE editor, dynamic navigation integration, and rich content capabilities. Subsequently, a robust email template system was added for booking confirmations, changes, and initial notifications. The booking management system was then enhanced with confirmation, rescheduling, double-booking prevention, and email notifications. Phase 1 focused on adding backend user account creation, a before/after gallery, and booking reminders. Phase 2 delivered a revenue tracking dashboard, break management, and staff portfolio enhancements. The current task involves debugging a recurring React input field focus loss issue in the staff editing form.

<current_work>
The AI engineer is currently debugging a bug where input fields in the Staff editing form (likely within  or  if it were a separate file) lose focus after a single character input. This indicates a React re-rendering issue caused by incorrect state updates.

Previous attempts to fix this involved modifying the  function and the  handlers. The engineer identified that the  component's state update mechanism was likely causing the re-renders.

The immediate challenge is to interact with the UI to confirm the fix. The testing steps involved taking a screenshot and attempting to click the edit icon for a staff member. This attempt failed because the screenshot tool could not locate the edit button. The engineer is currently investigating why the edit button is not being detected and suspects it might be due to an older version of the Staff management component being rendered or an incorrect selector in the testing script.
