The AI engineer successfully developed the Frisor LaFata barbershop website, adhering to a retro black/gold aesthetic. Development proceeded through several iterations, starting with the homepage and integrating a booking system with calendar features and initial PayPal support. Significant effort was dedicated to building a comprehensive, English-language admin dashboard offering full CRUD capabilities for bookings, staff, services, pages, and settings. Persistent bugs, such as unreadable calendar text, admin access issues, and input field focus loss in React forms, were systematically addressed. Most recently, the engineer resolved critical issues with delete functionality in the admin panel and implemented staff avatar upload, which required setting up static file serving in the backend and updating frontend display logic. The final action in the trajectory is to test the resolved avatar display.

<product_requirements>
The goal is to build a full-featured, mobile-friendly, fast, and elegant website for Frisor LaFata (frisorlafata.dk) with a retro barber-style aesthetic (black background, gold fonts).
**Frontend:** Homepage and subpages (services, about us, contact) with pixel-perfect, responsive design.
**Booking System:** Customers can book services (grouped categories, configurable duration, multiple services per booking) choosing staff, viewing available time slots via a calendar. Supports business hours, multiple staff, and sends editable, Danish email confirmations. Customer profiles include name, phone, email, and booking history.
**Payment:** PayPal integration (sandbox/live mode), with an option to pay in person and future expandability for other gateways.
**Backend:** MongoDB for bookings, services, users, and staff data. Features an admin login system with a dashboard for booking management (view, edit, delete), user management, a simple page editor (text, images, videos), and payment/email settings. Staff avatar upload is also required.

**Current Implementation Status:**
*   A visually appealing homepage and a functional booking system (calendar, staff selection, service grouping, PayPal integration) are implemented.
*   A comprehensive admin dashboard with full CRUD operations for bookings, staff, services, pages, and settings is complete, featuring an English interface.
*   The system includes staff scheduling, content editing for frontend pages, and payment/email configuration.
*   Delete functionality for staff and services, and staff avatar upload/display, are addressed with the latest fixes under review.

<current_work>
The AI engineer is currently in the process of resolving an issue where staff avatar images, despite being successfully uploaded, are not displaying on the frontend. This involves modifications to both the backend and frontend:

**Backend ():**
The engineer has already modified  to correctly serve static files. This involves adding  middleware to expose a directory (e.g., ) under a public URL path (e.g., ). The  environment variable has been referenced to ensure correct URL construction for these images.


**Frontend ( and ):**
The frontend components responsible for displaying staff details, particularly the staff cards in the  and the  component used for adding/editing staff, are being updated. These changes aim to construct the correct image URL for the avatar using  and the new  endpoint, and to gracefully handle cases where an avatar might not yet be uploaded. The latest edit involved improving the avatar display within the  component.

The product now has full CRUD admin capabilities, and the backend infrastructure for avatar upload and serving is established. The current focus is on making the frontend correctly render these uploaded avatars.
