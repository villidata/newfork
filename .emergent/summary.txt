The previous AI engineer's trajectory involved a multi-phase effort, starting with securing the self-hosted server with HTTPS and deploying a FastAPI backend with MySQL. The core challenge shifted to rebuilding and deploying a sophisticated React frontend on the user's VPS, as the initial AI-provided frontend was unsatisfactory.

The AI engineer faced significant challenges, including user frustration over credit usage and repeated debugging. Initial attempts to deploy the frontend were based on AI-generated components, leading to mismatches with the user's desired app preview. A persistent issue was the AI's inability to directly access the user's working preview code, necessitating a verbose, iterative process of providing generic code, debugging build errors (missing files, dependencies, aliases, Nginx configuration), and correcting component names ( vs. ).

Ultimately, the AI successfully guided the user through installing numerous frontend dependencies (Tailwind, Radix UI, i18n, Craco), configuring aliases, and correcting Nginx. The React application now builds successfully on the VPS and is served by Nginx. The primary unresolved point is the user's dissatisfaction with the visual and functional parity of the deployed site compared to their desired app preview, specifically regarding the corporate booking system. The final step was a suggestion to document the current status and push to Git.

The primary goal is a mobile-friendly barbershop website, Fris√∏r LaFata, with a retro black/gold theme. It requires a comprehensive homepage, subpages, and a robust booking system enabling staff, service, and time selection, email confirmations, and payment options. An English admin dashboard is crucial for managing bookings, staff, services, pages, and site settings. Desired enhancements include a rich text editor, email templates, advanced booking management (including corporate bookings with multi-person/service selection), user accounts, a before/after gallery, reminders, revenue tracking, staff break management, enhanced staff portfolios, customizable service icons, social media integration, home service options, and booking toggles. The immediate past requests focused on complete multi-language support, a responsive logo, a video background for the hero section with text overlay, and a comprehensive self-hosting deployment solution (cPanel/VPS) with custom MySQL configuration and SSL.

BookingSystem.jsclsxtailwind-merge
**Key files and their importance/changes:**
-   ****: FastAPI backend, MySQL integration, Pydantic models, auth, staff, service, booking, settings routes. Fully functional.
-   ****: Nginx configuration updated to serve React frontend from  and proxy  requests to . SSL is active.
-   ****: Main HTML template. Tailwind CSS CDN links were removed.
-   ****: Root React component. Imports  (previously ). Handles authentication and view switching (home/admin/admin-login).
-   ****: React entry point, imports  and .
-   ****: Global styles using Tailwind CSS directives and custom CSS variables.
-   ****: Directory containing numerous Radix UI components (e.g., , , , , , ), manually copied from the VS Code preview. Essential for the frontend's sophisticated UI.
-   ****: This file now exists on the VPS. It is the core booking component responsible for multi-step booking, including corporate/private options and staff/service/date/time selection.
-   ****: Utility file containing  function for class merging, required by UI components.
-   ****: Configures Webpack to resolve  imports to the  directory, fixing module not found errors for UI components.
-   ****: Updated to use  and  scripts. Contains numerous new dependencies (, , , , , , , ).

<pending_tasks>
-   Test the deployed React frontend thoroughly, especially the booking system's corporate/private options and calendar functionality, to ensure it matches the emergent.sh app preview.
-   Compare the overall styling and layout of  with the emergent.sh preview for visual parity.
-   Implement the Homepage Editor drag-and-drop functionality using .
-   Implement Phase 3 features (Loyalty points system, Recurring bookings, Gift Certificates, etc.).

Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer successfully resolved a series of critical build issues on the user's VPS at . This involved:
1.  **Installing missing core React dependencies** for internationalization ().
2.  **Fixing syntax errors** () where AI-provided code accidentally included extraneous instructions.
3.  **Installing numerous UI-related dependencies**: , , , , , , , , , and .
4.  **Creating a  file** with common utility functions (e.g.,  for class merging).
5.  **Configuring ** by installing it, creating , and updating  scripts to /. This resolved the  alias issue.
6.  **Manually copying a large number of missing UI components** (e.g., , , , , etc.) from the user's VS Code preview environment to .
7.  **Updating ** to import and use  instead of the erroneous  component name, which was a source of confusion.
8.  **Ensuring Nginx is correctly configured** to serve the built React app from  and proxy API requests.

The  command is now successfully completing (albeit with ESLint warnings about unused variables). The user's primary concern remains the visual and functional mismatch between the deployed site () and their emergent.sh app preview, specifically the corporate booking system. The AI's latest action was to suggest documenting the current project status and pushing all changes to GitHub for continuity.

<optional_next_step>
Test the deployed website (https://frisorlafata.dk) to verify the booking system's corporate/private options, calendar functionality, and overall styling match the desired app preview.
