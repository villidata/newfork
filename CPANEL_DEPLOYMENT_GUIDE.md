# 🚀 Frisør LaFata Website - cPanel Deployment Guide

## 📦 Files Prepared for Deployment

Your website has been successfully built and optimized for production deployment. Here's what you need to do:

## 🎯 Step 1: Download the Website Files

**File Location:** `/app/frontend/build/frisor-lafata-website.zip`

This ZIP file contains:
- ✅ **Optimized React build** (compressed and minified)
- ✅ **Multi-language support** (Danish/English switching)
- ✅ **Responsive logo** ("Frisør LaFata Klassik Barbering")
- ✅ **All website features** (booking system, gallery, contact forms)
- ✅ **SEO-optimized** static files
- ✅ **cPanel-ready .htaccess** file for React Router support

## 🖥️ Step 2: cPanel Upload Process

### Option A: File Manager Upload (Recommended)
1. **Login to your cPanel account**
2. **Open File Manager**
3. **Navigate to `public_html`** (or your domain's root directory)
4. **Upload the ZIP file:**
   - Click "Upload" button
   - Select `frisor-lafata-website.zip`
   - Wait for upload to complete
5. **Extract the files:**
   - Right-click the uploaded ZIP file
   - Select "Extract"
   - Choose "Extract files to `/public_html/`"
   - Delete the ZIP file after extraction

### Option B: FTP Upload
1. **Connect via FTP client** (FileZilla, WinSCP, etc.)
2. **Extract the ZIP locally first**
3. **Upload all files to your domain's root directory**
   - Usually `public_html/` or `www/`
   - Upload ALL files including the `.htaccess` file

## ⚙️ Step 3: Backend Configuration (IMPORTANT)

Your website currently connects to the development backend. You have **two options**:

### Option A: Use Current Backend (Easiest)
- ✅ **No changes needed** - website will continue using the existing backend
- ✅ **All features work immediately** (booking, admin, multi-language)
- ⚠️ **Note:** Backend is hosted on preview.emergentagent.com

### Option B: Setup Your Own Backend
If you want to host the backend on your own server:

1. **Backend Requirements:**
   - Python 3.8+ with FastAPI
   - MongoDB database
   - Email service (for booking confirmations)

2. **Configuration Change:**
   - Create new `.env` file with: `REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL=https://yourdomain.com`
   - Rebuild and redeploy frontend

## 🌐 Step 4: Domain Configuration

### If deploying to main domain (yourdomain.com):
- ✅ **Upload to `public_html/`**
- ✅ **No additional configuration needed**

### If deploying to subdirectory (yourdomain.com/barbershop):
1. **Create subdirectory in `public_html/barbershop/`**
2. **Upload files there**
3. **Update package.json** (if rebuilding):
   ```json
   "homepage": "/barbershop"
   ```

## 🔧 Step 5: Essential cPanel Settings

### 1. Enable Mod_Rewrite (for React Router)
- Go to **"Apache Configuration" or "Mod_Rewrite"**
- Enable mod_rewrite if not already enabled
- The included `.htaccess` file handles URL routing

### 2. Set PHP Version (if backend hosting)
- **Recommended:** PHP 7.4 or higher
- Go to **"Select PHP Version"**

### 3. SSL Certificate
- Go to **"SSL/TLS"**
- Enable **"Force HTTPS Redirect"**
- Install SSL certificate if not already done
